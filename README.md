# tddIntro
This project contains the necessary code to understand the Test driven development

## Introduction

Three step process
1. Write a test that fails (Red - Fail)
2. Write only enough code to make it pass (Green - Pass)
3. Complete the implementation to meet requirements of all the test (Refactor)

## Advantages
1. The essence of TDD is thinking test scenarios before implementation.
2. Can expose poorly designed monolithic code
3. TDD reduces the bias towards the requirement assumptions
4. Ability to bypass or mock dependencies of functions
5. Code coverage is the percentage of total code being executed by tests and try to make it 100%
